<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<p>Maximus (Russell Crowe) is a general in the roman army loved by Marcus Aurelius, 
    the emperor. Marcus wants Maximus to become emperor after he dies as he thinks that 
    his son Commodus is unfit to rule. When he tells Commodus this, Commodus murders him. 
    When Maximus refuses to believe that Marcus died of natural causes, Commodus orders that 
    Maximus and his family should be executed. However, Maximus escapes and returns home - too 
    late to save his family. He collapses and is sold as a slave where his prowess as a gladiator 
    gets noticed and eventually he fights his way through Africa to Rome, where he meets the emperor 
    face to face. The emperor spares his life, then challenges Maximus to a fight in the arena. 
    Maximus accepts and the two engage in a bloody battle. Maximus kills the emperor, reinstates 
    the Senate as the governors of Rome and dies to be with his family in the afterlife.</p>
<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>Fight Club is a 1996 novel by Chuck Palahniuk. It follows the experiences of an unnamed protagonist 
    struggling with insomnia. Inspired by his doctor's exasperated remark that insomnia is not suffering, 
    the protagonist finds relief by impersonating a seriously ill person in several support groups. 
    Then he meets a mysterious man named Tyler Durden and establishes an underground fighting club as 
    radical psychotherapy.</p>
<h3>Human</h3>
<p>Human is a 2015 documentary by French environmentalist Yann Arthus-Bertrand. The film is almost entirely 
    composed of exclusive aerial footage and first-person stories told into the camera. It was the first film 
    to premiere in the General Assembly Hall of the United Nations, to an audience of 1,000 viewers, including 
    the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. The film was financed by the Bettencourt Schueller Foundation, 
    which gave it rights-free to the GoodPlanet Foundation, responsible for driving the project. 
    An extended version of the film is officially freely available on YouTube (in three parts).</p>
